# SeeLink - The easiest way to share links with friends, family, and teammates.

This is the repository for SeeLink [https://seelink.app]. Feel free to create an issue if you want to request a feature, or just want to chat. Also let me know if you'd prefer something like Discord to do this. All the features I'll be adding will be stored in this ReadMe. Feel free to submit a PR and add some yourself! Owing to code cleanliness reasons, it contains no code, but don't let that deter you. If you want to help me create a developer API for SeeLink, you can reach me at raghavnautiyal26@gmail.com üòÅ

# Coming Soon

There's a ton of features I've planned for SeeLink. Some of them are:

- Chrome / Firefox extension
- Minor changes to the structure of links
- Adding board descriptions
- Developer API
