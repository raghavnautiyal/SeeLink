# SeeLink - The easiest way to share links with friends, family, and teammates.

This is the repository for SeeLink. Feel free to create an issue if you want to request a feature, or just want to chat. All the features I'll be adding will be stored in this ReadMe. Feel free to submit a PR and add some yourself! Owing to code cleanliness reasons, it contains no code, but don't let that deter you. If you want to help me create a developer API for SeeLink, Reach me at raghavnautiyal26@gmail.com 😁

# Coming Soon

There's a ton of features I've planned for SeeLink. Some of them are:

- Chrome / Firefox extension
- Minor hanges to the structure of links
- Adding board descriptions
- Developer API
